Welcome to Cooper's personal website repository! 

I'm a self-taught programmer who loves computer science and technology. Here,

problem-solving. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities
to grow. Embracing each experience as a chance to learn and expand my skills,
I am dedicated to continuous improvement in both my personal and professional life. 

Whether you're interested in this website or just curious about me, why not
